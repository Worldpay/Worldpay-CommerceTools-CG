# `@gradientedge/mach-api-context`

The context package provides a way to store a request's context information without the need to pass it through to
the code that uses this context. This is especially useful for low-layer functions and avoid passing a variable through
a whole chain of functions that only receive the information to pass it down.

## Usage

```
const context = require('@gradientedge/mach-api-context');

// TODO: DEMONSTRATE API
```
